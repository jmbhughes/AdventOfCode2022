# AdventOfCode2022
This year I plan to do the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) as a fun practice. 

- Days 1 through 6 are in Go. 
- Days 7 through the end are in Python. 

All problems were solved independently first. 
Some solutions have been rewritten to a better solution (in my opinion) after looking at other people's solutions. 
Those days have a comment indicating that they were "inspired by X" where X is a link to the other repo.
I only rewrote if I found their solution substantially better than mine.
This was done sparingly to preserve my original ideas.
